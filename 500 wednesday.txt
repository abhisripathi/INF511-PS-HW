I am an international student persuing my master's degree. Currently. I have paid all my tuition fee on my own. I do not have part-time job offers 
and I have shortage of money to pay my housing and grocery bills. 

I am the first person in my family to persue master's in USA, and thus the first to attend college. 

I enrolled in vidyadivena HELP program during my undergraduation year, which covers tuition and fees at select colleges in the state. 
 
However, present I still need funding for books, supplies, and transportation to campus as needed. 
This scholarship would help me avoid costly student loans that could take years to repay.  

It will be very helpful for me if I get the NAU leaf grant.
